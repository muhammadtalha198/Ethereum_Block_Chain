" Multi-signature wallets or “multisig wallets”   for short, are a type of cryptocurrency
  wallet for which at least two private  keys are needed to sign a  transaction.  Imagine 
  a secure locker with two locks and two keys held by two parties that can only be opened 
  if both provide their keys, thus  ensuring that one   party is not able to open the box 
  without the other partys permission.In the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a multi-signature 
  transaction is required for   opening a payment channel between two parties, where each 
  partner locks a certain amount of bitcoins into a multisig wallet and then receives one 
  of two required keys.In the following, we show the Git repository of reviewed files and 
  the commit hash value used in this audit."
